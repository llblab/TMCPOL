## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added

- **Consolidated Specification**: Unified `tmctol.en.md` integrating Foundation → Architecture → Mathematics → Economics → Dynamics → Implementation → Trade-offs
- **Legitimacy Phase Documentation**: Academic rigor with conditional guarantees throughout entire specification
- **Layered Abstraction Insights**: Cognitive scaffolding patterns for progressive comprehension

- **Invoice Voting Mechanics**: DOUBLE/APPROVE/REDUCE/VETO voting system
- **Axial Router Specification**: Comprehensive routing gateway with TVL-weighted EMA protection

### Changed

- **Documentation Evolution**: Transformed from aspirational claims to mathematically grounded analysis
- **Floor Protection Range**: Updated from "11%" to "11-25% range, governance-dependent"
- **Guarantee Framework**: All claims marked with explicit governance/parameter dependencies
- **Mathematical Notation**: Enhanced with dimensional analysis and boundary conditions
- **Naming Consistency**: Type-first discipline with dimensional prefix convention
- **Testing Philosophy**: Shift from mathematical correctness to economic attack simulation

### Removed

- **Marketing Language**: Eliminated "revolutionary," "breakthrough," "innovation" terminology
- **Absolute Guarantees**: Replaced with conditional guarantees based on governance maintenance
- **Separate Analysis Documents**: Consolidated `price-boundaries.en.md` into main specification
